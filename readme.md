# Stock Image Bot
A discord bot written in Python. Mainly for use by N0ice and StockImageSharks servers
## Files:
### bot2.py 
Version 2 of StockImageBot, this currently has most of the same commands as version 1, but links with an SQLite3 database.
### bot2-db-build.py
This creates the database that is used by version 2 of the bot. This should be run whenever setting up the bot on a new machine.
## Old Code:
### build.sql
code used to build the SQLite3 database, this is now included in the build python file.
### bot.py 
Version 1 of StockImageBot, no longer active.
### meedbot.py
This is code for an old bot that no-longer functions. Was used to build version 1 of Sock Image Bot

## E-Ink Images
These are images to be used with an e-ink display, as part of a plan to set-up the bot to run on a Raspberry Pi 3.
The e-ink display will show that the bot is online / will display error codes / bot stats.
